Umberto,

Hope this finds you well.

We have been retained by a tier 1 bank on a Group Head of Infrastructure & Security Engineering search and I was wondering if you would be open to a call this week? It would be great to connect and hear your thoughts.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,

Daniel
